### What is Tableau ?
Tableau is business & analytics software tool that helps people to understand, visualise & make data driven decisions in real time with extreme agility & accuracy.In simple words to extract information from a huge data sets we use tableau which in turn write SQL queries by itself based on visualisations selected by developer & make it interative to give meaningful insights.

### Versions of Tableau 
1) Tableau Desktop: Data viz application that facitilates user to examine virtually all types of structured data & generate interactive graphs, dashboards & reports quickly.
2) Tableau Server: BI application that offers browser based analytics, its an alternative to slow paced tableau desktop which is online & thus can be shared online, best for distributing & collaborating.
3) Tableau Online: Same as server its also a BI application that offers browser based analytics, its an alternative to slow paced tableau desktop, its a secure cloud based solutions used for sharing & collaborating on tableau views & dashboards.
4) Tableau Public: Free software to connect to a spreadsheet/file and create interative data visualisations for the web.
5) Tableau Reader: free desktop application that you can use to open & interact with data visualisations built in Tableau Desktop.  

### Tableau Features
1) Robust Security
  a) Provides proper Authentication for user access & data connections.
  b) Also provide you to integrate with other security protocols like active directory, kerberos etc.
  c) Practices low level filtering which helps to secure data.
2) Collaboration & Sharing
   Just like any other BI tool you can easily share reports/sheets/dashboards created in Tableau with other users via on-premise, cloud, hybrid etc.
3) Easy to do Time series & forecasting or drawing trend lines.
4) Provides both Live & in memory data connections.
5) Facitilates wide range of charts some unique ones are ghantt, motion chart etc.
6) Capable to show mobile view as well.
7) Wide range of Data sources.

### Advantages of Tableau
1) Remarkable visualisation
2) Ease of use
3) High Performance
4) Mobile friendly
5) Rich community

### Disadvantages of Tableau
1) High Cost
2) Inflexible pricing (pricing is independent of customer requirement)
3) Poor after sales support
4) Poor BI capabilities
5) Poor Version control

### Hands on with Tableau
1) First perform all the necessary joins based on your requirement

### How to extract data sets in Tableau?
You can extract any report (in .hyper format) by going to Data tab -> Report Name -> Extract Data and now either you can extract everything in one table or to multiple tables & also you can select how to identify new rows by checking increamental refresh & then selecing the column name with which you want to identify them.





### How to create calculated fields in Tableau?
1) Right click on any columan name -> create -> create calculated field
2) Go to analysis from menu tab -> create calculated field
3) You can also create from drop down just near the Dimensions section.




### Connecting to Tableau Server
From the starting screen click on Tableau Server & enter your server url -> Connect. After that enter credentials & you are done.

### Joining & Blending
##### Joins
To perform any type of join just drag the tables in data source section & then select the type of join along with column names with which you want to perform join.  
By default tableau performs inner join, though you can do left,right & full outer joins as well.  
In case sometimes right & full outer join is disabled then what you can do is write your own New Custom SQL but this options generally appears once you established connection from a database that is legacy connection though earlier it was also available for excel files. (Where while importing the excel files you not open it normally but select 'open with legacy connection' to get New Custom SQL option.  
Joins are particularly useful when almost all the dimensions are coming from the same data source.

##### Blending
When your data is coming from multiple sources then after pulling those sources in Tableau you can directly use in columns from those different data sources & by default Tableau tags those sources as primary & secondary & just after the secondary source it puts an infinity symbol which basically tells developer to not use columns as linking fields. In this case you will not be able to perform joins as Tableau by default is doing blending your data. This is very useful when you have heterogenous data sources.



### Connectin Type (Live & Extract)
Live : Any change in the data source will directly reflect in Tableau sheets.
Extract : It imports data first into Tableau Data Engine so any change in data source will not directly reflect in sheets but the speed of operation performed on this data will be much faster.
While selecting extract option you can add filters as well, also you can add incremental refresh based on certain fields. (More or less you can refer this type of connection as offline)






### Practice Sets

#### Q1: Reviewing profit per state in decending order & also seeing which orders have been returned per state per customer ?

Steps to perform
1) Import Sample superstore data set 
2) Inner join between orders & People based on Region
3) Left join between order & returns based on Order Id
4) Go to sheet 1 & add state & person in rows 
5) Add distinct count of order id (returns) & sum(profit) to columns
6) sort based on profit

#### Q2: Create a set to show states with 100 or more customers ?
Sol: Right click on any column name -> Create -> Set -> Give set Name -> go to condition -> By field > Count(Customer Name) >= 100

#### Q3: Create calculated fields to show the average sales per customer?
Col Name : Avg sales per customer
Sol: AVG({INCLUDE [Customer Name]:SUM([Sales])})

#### Q4: Calculated fields to show sales goals?
Col Name : Sales Goal
Sol: 
if MIN([States with 100+ Customers])= TRUE
THEN SUM([Sales]) *1.3
ELSE [Avg sales per customer]*100
END

#### Q5: Calculated fields to show emerging & developing states?
Col Name: Emerging or Developing State
Sol:
if COUNTD([Customer Name]) >= 100
then "Developing State"
else "Emerging State"
END

#### Q6: Use Q3, Q4 & Q5 and show avg(sales goal) & sum(sales) & distinct(customer count) per state?
Sol: 
1) Add Agg(sales goal) in columns
2) Add State in Rows 
Now you should be able to see Sales goal per state 
3) Now add customer name in columns & make it distinct
4) Make it(Customer Name) discrete if its continous as its discreate entity.
4) Add Sum(sales) in Column
5) Go to Show me & select bullet graph
6) Now since only one thing can be in columns you can right click on the x-axis & select swap reference line fields
Add on
7) Now put Emerging or Developing State in color & rename the sheet as well to the same.
8) You can sort based on distinct customer count or sales goal
